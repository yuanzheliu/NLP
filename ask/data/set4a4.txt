Who, during the initial grinding and polishing of the mirror, analyzed its surface with two conventional refractive null correctors?
What, however, lacked any intermediate surfaces that could be figured in this way, and so required an external correction device?

Who intended to use custom-built and extremely sophisticated computer-controlled polishing machines to grind the mirror to the required shape?
What, in 1962, by the US National Academy of Sciences recommended the development of a space telescope as part of the space program, and in 1965 Spitzer was appointed as head of a committee given the task of defining scientific objectives for a large space telescope?
Is hubble the only telescope designed to be serviced in space by astronauts?
What, in 1970, established two committees, one to plan the engineering side of the space telescope project, and the other to determine the scientific goals of the mission?
Is the HSP in the Space Place at the University of Wisconsin-Madison?
What, in 1974, led to Congress deleting all funding for the telescope project?
Is the current location of GHRS unclear?
