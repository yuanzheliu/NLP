Who observed it again later, in 1848, using a 72-inch (1.8 m) telescope and could not confirm the supposed resemblance, but the name stuck nevertheless?
What revealed that a new star bright enough to be seen in the daytime had been recorded in the same part of the sky by Chinese astronomers in 1054?
Is the Crab Pulsar believed to be about 28–30 km (17–19 mi) in diameter; it emits pulses of radiation every 33 milliseconds?
What showed that the thickness of Titan's atmosphere is 880 km (550 mi)?
Was in the 1960s it found that the source of the curved paths of the electrons was the strong magnetic field produced by a neutron star at the centre of the nebula?
What taken several years apart reveal the slow expansion of the nebula, and by comparing this angular expansion with its spectroscopically determined expansion velocity, the nebula's distance can be estimated?
Is in 1953 iosif shklovsky proposed that the diffuse blue region predominantly produced by synchrotron radiation?
What to account for the missing mass of the Crab Nebula is that a substantial proportion of the mass of the progenitor was carried away before the supernova explosion in a fast stellar wind, a phenomenon commonly seen in Wolf-Rayet stars?
Is the inner part of the nebula a much smaller pulsar wind nebula that appears as a shell surrounding the pulsar?
What used the Chandra X-ray Observatory to observe Saturn's moon Titan as it crossed the nebula, and found that Titan's X-ray 'shadow' was larger than its solid surface, due to absorption of X-rays in its atmosphere?
